# rummikub
The rummikub game created in Rust

## Setup
Check Bevy's [setup instructions](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/) and make sure you install all the required dependencies.
Additionally, [install LLD](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/#alternative-linkers) unless you're on MacOS.

Then, run `cargo build`. The first compliation will take a couple minutes, any compilation after that will only re-compile the files changed by you.
If you encounter problems, open a [new issue](https://github.com/PCOffline/rummikub/issues/new).
